# Assignment1: MLPs and Backpropagation
**Due on November 4, 2022 (23:59:59)**

Welcome to comp541!

The main goal of this practical is to make you understand the basics of neural network design and training, and you will also get familiar with Facebookâ€™s Pytorch deep learning framework. In this practical you will use the [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) and then utilize the word embeddings for sentiment classification using the [DAN](https://aclanthology.org/P15-1162.pdf) approach.

* `assignment1.ipynb` : Contains all of the coding questions, and will automatically generate and display results for you after completing each question.
* `env.yml` : Create your working environment.

# Set-up
We'll be using Python throughout the course. If you've got a good Python setup already, great! But make sure that it is at least Python version 3.5. If not, the easiest thing to do is to make sure you have at least 3GB free on your computer and then to head over to (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and install the Python 3 version of Anaconda. It will work on any operating system.

After you have installed conda, close any open terminals you might have. Then open a new terminal and run the following command:

## Step1
Create an environment with dependencies specified in env.yml:
    
    conda env create -f env.yml

## Step2
Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate comp541
    
## Step3
Inside the new environment, instatll IPython kernel so we can use this environment in jupyter notebook: 
    
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name comp541


## Step4
Homework 1 (only) is a Jupyter Notebook. With the above done you should be able to get underway by typing:

    jupyter notebook exploring_word_vectors.ipynb
    
## Step5
To make sure we are using the right environment, go to the toolbar of exploring_word_vectors.ipynb, click on Kernel -> Change kernel, you should see and select comp541 in the drop-down menu.

## Step6
To deactivate an active environment, use
    
    conda deactivate

**What to submit**

* Download a .ipynb version of your notebook, please name this as `username_assignment1.ipynb` such as `eacikgoz17_assignment1.ipynb` and submit it to Blackboard by the deadline. You don't have to submit anything else.
